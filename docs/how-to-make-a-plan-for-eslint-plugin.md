# How to Create an Effective Plan for an ESLint Plugin

Creating a well-structured plan is crucial for developing a high-quality ESLint plugin. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a comprehensive plan using the `@ospm/eslint-plugin-react-signals-hooks` as an example.

## 1. Start with a Clear Structure

Begin by organizing your plan into clear, logical sections. A good structure includes:

- **Introduction**: Brief description of the plugin's purpose
- **Rule Categories**: Group related rules together
- **Individual Rules**: Detailed implementation plans for each rule
- **Configuration Options**: Available settings for each rule
- **Test Cases**: Scenarios to verify the rule works as expected

## 2. Define Each Rule's Purpose

For each rule, clearly state its goal. For example:

```markdown
### 1.1 `prefer-batch-updates`

**Goal**: Detect multiple signal mutations in the same scope and suggest wrapping them in `batch()`.
```

## 3. Outline Implementation Steps

Break down each rule into clear implementation steps:

1. **AST Analysis**:
   - Identify relevant code patterns
   - Track variables and their usages
   - Determine the scope of analysis

2. **Configuration Options**:
   - List available configuration parameters
   - Specify default values
   - Explain when to use each option

3. **Autofix Capabilities**:
   - Describe how the rule can automatically fix issues
   - Explain any limitations of the autofix
   - Note any potential side effects

## 4. Include Comprehensive Test Cases

List test scenarios that cover:

- Basic functionality
- Edge cases
- Different code patterns
- Various configuration options

Example:

```markdown
**Test Cases**:
- Multiple mutations in event handlers
- Mutations in different branches
- Nested scopes
- With existing batch calls
```

## 5. Consider Performance Implications

For performance-sensitive rules, include:

- Expected performance characteristics
- Any known performance bottlenecks
- Optimization strategies

## 6. Document Configuration Options

Provide clear documentation for each configuration option:

- Name and type
- Default value
- Effect on the rule's behavior
- Example usage

## 7. Plan for Edge Cases

Consider and document how the rule should handle:

- Complex code patterns
- Different coding styles
- Potential false positives/negatives
- Interactions with other rules

## 8. Example Plan Structure

Here's a condensed example based on the existing PLAN.md:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan for Your ESLint Plugin

## 1. Rule Category

### 1.1 Rule Name

**Goal**: Clear, one-sentence description of what the rule enforces.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **AST Analysis**:
   - What to look for in the code
   - How to track relevant information

2. **Configuration**:
   - Available options and their effects
   - Default values

3. **Autofix**:
   - How the fix will work
   - Any limitations

**Test Cases**:
- Scenario 1
- Scenario 2
- Edge case
```

## 9. Review and Refine

Before implementation:

- Review the plan with team members
- Consider real-world usage scenarios
- Look for potential improvements or missing cases
- Ensure the plan aligns with the plugin's overall goals

By following this structured approach, you'll create a comprehensive plan that guides development and ensures your ESLint plugin is robust, configurable, and effective at enforcing code quality standards.

```markdown
# ESLint Plugin Plan: @example/eslint-plugin-custom

## 1. Introduction
Brief description of the plugin's purpose and goals.

## 2. Rule Categories
- Performance
- Best Practices
- Style

## 3. Rule: rule-name
### Purpose
What problem does this rule solve?

### Implementation
1. AST Analysis
   - Target node types
   - Scope analysis

2. Configuration
   - Available options
   - Default values

3. Test Cases
   - Valid examples
   - Invalid examples
   - Edge cases

## 4. Performance Considerations
- Complexity analysis
- Optimization strategies

## 5. Documentation
- Rule documentation structure
- Examples
- Configuration options
```
