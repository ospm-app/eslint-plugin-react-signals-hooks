# Additional Rules for @ospm/eslint-plugin-react-signals-hooks

Based on the implemented rules in your plugin (extracted from the npm page: `exhaustive-deps`, `require-use-signals`, `no-mutation-in-render`, `prefer-signal-in-jsx`, `prefer-show-over-ternary`, `prefer-for-over-map`, `prefer-signal-effect`, `prefer-computed`, and `signal-variable-name`), I've analyzed documentation from @preact/signals-react (via npm README and Preact guide), @preact/signals-core (integrated in the guide), and related packages like @preact/signals-react-transform and community variants (e.g., @preact-signals/safe-react, Unison.js for deeper React signals). Key sources include best practices (e.g., batching, untracked accesses, direct JSX optimization), pitfalls (e.g., overusing peek/untracked, failing to clean up effects, lazy computeds), and React integrations (e.g., useSignalEffect for lifecycle-tied effects, utilities like Show/For, hooks like useLiveSignal/useSignalRef).

The suggestions avoid overlap with your existing rules (e.g., no duplicates for preferring computed or effects, mutations in render, or JSX preferences). Instead, they focus on untapped areas like batching, untracked/peek usage, ref handling, signal creation placement, effect cleanup, and utilities from @preact/signals-react/utils. Rules emphasize performance, reactivity safety, and migration from React primitives. All support TypeScript, autofix where safe, and configurable severity.

I've grouped them into categories, with tables summarizing each rule, purpose (tied to docs), options, and examples.

## ‚úÖ Performance and Update Optimization Rules

These enforce batching and untracked to prevent unnecessary re-renders or subscriptions, as highlighted in docs for efficient multi-updates and non-reactive reads.

| Status | Rule Name | Description | Implementation |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ‚úÖ Done | `prefer-batch-for-multi-mutations` | Suggests wrapping multiple signal mutations with `batch()`. | Implemented in `prefer-batch-for-multi-mutations.ts` |
| ‚úÖ Done | `warn-on-unnecessary-untracked` | Warns on unnecessary use of `untracked()` or `.peek()` in reactive contexts. | Implemented in `warn-on-unnecessary-untracked.ts` |

## üîÑ Hook and Primitive Migration Rules

These promote signal-specific hooks over React equivalents for better reactivity, extending your `prefer-*` rules to refs and state.

| Status | Rule Name | Description | Implementation |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ‚úÖ Done | `prefer-use-signal-over-use-state` | Suggests replacing `useState` with `useSignal` for primitive values. | Implemented in `prefer-use-signal-over-use-state.ts` |

## ‚úÖ Safety and Lifecycle Rules

These prevent leaks or bugs in effects and signal creation, based on cleanup needs and component lifecycle from docs.

| Status | Rule Name | Description | Implementation |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ‚úÖ Done | `no-signal-creation-in-render` | Disallows creating signals inside component render body. | Implemented as `no-signal-creation-in-component.ts` |
| ‚ùå Not Done | `require-effect-cleanup` | Warns if `useSignalEffect` performs side effects without cleanup. | Not yet implemented |

## ‚ùå Advanced Utility and Sync Rules

These encourage utilities from `@preact/signals-react/utils` for syncing and advanced patterns, inspired by hook examples.

| Status | Rule Name | Description | Implementation |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ‚ùå Not Done | `prefer-use-live-signal-for-sync` | Suggests `useLiveSignal` for syncing local to external signals. | Not yet implemented |

## Implementation Notes

- **Detection Logic**: Extend your AST analysis to identify imports from `@preact/signals-react` and `@preact/signals-react/utils`, track mutations/accesses in scopes (e.g., handlers for batch), and detect side-effect patterns in callbacks (e.g., for cleanup).
- **Config Options**: Add plugin-level `signalsUtilsImport: string` (default: '@preact/signals-react/utils') for utilities. Include `enableDangerousAutofix` for rules like batch (could alter behavior if nested).
- **Severity and Autofix**: Default to 'warn'; mark `[AUTOFIXABLE]` in messages. Test for false positives, e.g., in non-mutative batches.
- **Why These?**: They address undocumented pitfalls (e.g., no cleanup leaks from guide), performance tips (batching/untracked from core docs), and React-specific utils (useLiveSignal/useSignalRef from npm). Community packages like Unison.js emphasize deep reactivity (e.g., ref rules), while avoiding overlap with your prefs for Show/For/computed/effect.
- **Expansions**: If adding SSR support, consider `no-unsafe-ssr-access` (warn on non-JSON-safe signals). Monitor v2+ breaking changes for global state rules.

These would round out your plugin for comprehensive @preact/signals-react coverage, helping users avoid subtle bugs. If you provide the GitHub repo URL, I can analyze the code for more tailored suggestions!
